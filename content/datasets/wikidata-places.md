<!-- Copy of catalog/wikidata-places.md of https://github.com/confref/confref-data (cr sync-site); change it there. -->
The Wikidata items that `ls-places` names as the places of events (cities, regions, countries, some venues) and
their countries, as Wikidata states them: country, coordinates, class, the administrative unit they lie in, ISO
codes, population, and the labels in English, German and for all languages. The map and the place filters of the
platform are made from them.
