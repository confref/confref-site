<!-- Copy of catalog/ratings-springer-lod.md of https://github.com/confref/confref-data (cr sync-site); change it there. -->
The ratings of 742 conference series that Springer published in its linked open data: the CORE ranking, Qualis, the
GII-GRIN-SCIE rating and the CCF list as Springer loaded them on 6 April 2017, and the h5-index and h5-median of
Google Scholar of 2017. Each rating names its series, its system, its value and its date. Springer did not record
which edition of a ranking it loaded. The ratings are old; they show how a series was rated then, not now.
