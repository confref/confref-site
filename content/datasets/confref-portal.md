<!-- Copy of catalog/confref-portal.md of https://github.com/confref/confref-data (cr sync-site); change it there. -->
The 37,945 conferences of 5,668 series of portal.confref.org (2019-2022), the prototype of confref built with the
Digital Science Catalyst Grant, as its API delivered them on 2020-07-11: name, acronym, place, year, dates, series
(with ISSN and DBLP id), research area and keywords. Mostly computer science, from the Springer Nature metadata API
(2002 on) and DBLP. The portal is offline; the download was kept by Wolfgang Fahl's ConferenceCorpus.

True to the API, with terms in the dataset namespace (`vocab/`). Known limits of the source: many dates are
placeholders (start and end on 1 January of the year, 6,365 events), some years are impossible (0, 19670), the
rankings were never filled.
