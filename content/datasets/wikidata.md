The conferences of Wikidata: 35,271 items that are academic conferences or workshops, academic conference series,
carry an identifier of a conference or series (dblp, WikiCFP, KISTI, ACM) or are the proceedings of an event, with
all their truthy statements (dates, places, series, organisers, subjects, the conference identifiers and many
more), and their labels, aliases and descriptions in English, German and for all languages. Wikidata is the hub of
the identifiers of conferences; this is also the set confref will give its links back to.
