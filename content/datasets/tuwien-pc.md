The programme committees of 45 conferences (2009-2015: ACISP, ARCS, CRYPTO, DEXA, ECOOP, ESWC, ISWC, MICCAI, SIGMOD
and others), 3,944 memberships with name, role, affiliation and country, made by the Linked Data Lab of TU Wien in 2015
for the Springer LOD pilot: student groups extracted the committees from the conference websites and calls for
papers, cleaned them by hand and mapped them to RDF in the model of lod.springer.com; countries and some affiliations
are linked to DBpedia. Shown as a pilot on lod.springer.com; TU Wien agreed to its use (2018).

Kept for reference only: nothing in confref builds on it (decision 0010). Persons are not identified beyond their
names.
