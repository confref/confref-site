<!-- Copy of catalog/ls-confref-portal-events.md of https://github.com/confref/confref-data (cr sync-site); change it there. -->
The events of `confref-portal` linked to the same events of other sources (`cr:sameAs`), found by rules within series that
are already linked: the series records of the sources are joined into clusters by the identity links that pass the
quality threshold (dblp venue keys, Wikidata items, and the judged linkset `ls-springer-lod-dblp`); within a cluster
and a year, an event is matched to the only event of the other source, or, where a source has several, to the one
that agrees in edition number, start date or acronym. Contradicting edition numbers or dates block a link. The file
`ls-confref-portal-events-matches.tsv.gz` lists every link with its rule and the facts of both events.
