<!-- Copy of catalog/confref-ontology.md of https://github.com/confref/confref-data (cr sync-site); change it there. -->
The classes and properties of the confref data (decision 0014): the terms of confref (`cr:`,
`https://id.confref.org/ontology/`) where no other vocabulary has one, and how the identifier set `ids` and the
linksets use the terms of other vocabularies (schema.org, Dublin Core, SKOS, OWL). Documented on
[www.confref.org/ontology/](https://www.confref.org/ontology/); the source is the repository confref-ontology.
