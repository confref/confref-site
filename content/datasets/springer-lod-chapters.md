<!-- Copy of catalog/springer-lod-chapters.md of https://github.com/confref/confref-data (cr sync-site); change it there. -->
The 1,251,627 chapters of the books in the lod.springer.com dump of 2018-06-04 (title, authors, pages, DOI, dates,
indexing in Scopus and Compendex), with their IRIs in the copy on lod.confref.org (2018-08). Papers rather than
conference data: kept as part of the legacy base, not loaded into the endpoint. The books are in springer-lod.
