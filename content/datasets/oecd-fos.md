The fields of science and technology of the OECD (Frascati Manual, revised 2007) as SKOS concepts: 6 major fields
and 42 fields, with their codes and their English and German names. They are the academic fields of confref: the
fields of the sources are mapped to them in `ls-fields`. ConfIDent uses the same classification.
