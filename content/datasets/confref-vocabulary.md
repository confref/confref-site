<!-- Copy of catalog/confref-vocabulary.md of https://github.com/confref/confref-data (cr sync-site); change it there. -->
The values of the catalogue fields `kind` and `method` as SKOS concepts, generated from `catalog/vocabulary.toml`:
what a dataset is (records, authority data, linkset, ratings and others) and how it was made. The description of
every dataset names them as its types (`dcterms:type`).
