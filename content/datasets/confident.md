<!-- Copy of catalog/confident.md of https://github.com/confref/confref-data (cr sync-site); change it there. -->
ConfIDent, the registry of academic events of TIB (Hannover), made in a DFG project of TIB and RWTH Aachen
(2019-2023) and curated by TIB since: events of all fields with their series, dates, place, mode, organising
institutions, academic fields, deadlines, figures (submitted and accepted papers, attendees) and identifiers (their
DataCite DOIs, DBLP, Wikidata, WikiCFP, ROR); fee-based events are reviewed before they are included, to keep out
predatory events.

True to the source (decision 0011): every structured property of the wiki as it states it, one record per page and
per subobject (organiser, deadline, maintainer), named by the page ID; the deletions, moves and merges of the wiki.
ConfIDent is actively curated: the dataset needs regular updates to stay in sync with it.
