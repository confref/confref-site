The source of this page is the repository [confref-ontology](https://github.com/confref/confref-ontology). The ontology is also the dataset
[confref-ontology](../datasets/confref-ontology/); the namespace `https://id.confref.org/ontology/` gives this page to
a browser and the Turtle file to a linked data client.

Namespace: `https://id.confref.org/ontology/` (prefix `cr:`). The Turtle file [confref-ontology.ttl](https://github.com/confref/confref-ontology/blob/main/confref-ontology.ttl) is generated from the code blocks of this document.

Status: published 2026-11-09 as the dataset `confref-ontology` (one version per change, on archive.confref.org and in
the SPARQL endpoint of labs.confref.org); terms can still be added and changed.

## What this document describes

The **common layer** of the confref data: the classes and properties used by the identifier set `ids` (the series and
events behind the landing pages) and by our linksets, our own and those of other vocabularies. The model is described
in confref-data decision 0013.

Own terms are defined with `rdfs:label` and `rdfs:comment`. Terms of other vocabularies are described only with
`cr:label` and `cr:comment`; their definitions stay with their vocabularies. Our own terms are added only where no
term of another vocabulary fits.

The vocabularies of single sources are documented by the sources or by the vocabulary files of their datasets (dblp:
the dblp ontology; Wikidata: direct properties `wdt:`; GND: the GND Ontology; ConfIDent: the file
`confident-vocabulary.ttl.gz` of the dataset `confident`; the Springer LOD ontology: the file
`springer-lod-ontology.ttl.gz` of the dataset `springer-lod`).

## Describing terms

Interfaces take the label of a term from `cr:label` (for our own terms: `rdfs:label`), so that they show our label
even when the original vocabulary is loaded as well.

### cr:label {#label}
```
cr:label
    a owl:AnnotationProperty ;
    rdfs:label "label (confref)"@en ;
    rdfs:comment "The label confref uses for a term in its interfaces."@en ;
    rdfs:subPropertyOf rdfs:label .
```
### cr:comment {#comment}
```
cr:comment
    a owl:AnnotationProperty ;
    rdfs:label "usage note (confref)"@en ;
    rdfs:comment "How confref uses a term."@en ;
    rdfs:subPropertyOf rdfs:comment .
```

## Series and events

A series is a sequence of recurring events under one name: a conference, workshop or symposium series. An event is
one meeting: a conference, workshop or symposium, a joint or federated event (confref-data decisions 0013, 0017).

The relations are many-to-many:

- `cr:inSeries`: the series of an event. A joint conference that is branded and run as one event belongs to the
  series of each partner.
- `cr:heldAt`: the larger event an event is part of or hosted by: a workshop at its main conference, the partner
  conferences of a joint conference that presents as a collection, a conference at a federated event. The series of
  an event is independent of the series of its host.
- `cr:jointWith`, `cr:colocatedWith`: separate events held together (joint organisation or programme), or at the same
  place and time with programmes of their own. Both are symmetric.

The sources record joint conferences in each of these ways, and confref keeps the way of the source. The same joint
conference can appear as one event in two series and as two events joint with each other; the links show how they
are connected.

schema.org and AEON define a series as a kind of event. confref keeps the two levels apart, so its classes are its
own, with schema.org's as superclasses. The terms of AEON (the Academic Event Ontology,
`http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/AEON_…`, also used by ConfIDent) are recorded as close matches.

## Facts of an event

The edition number, the status, the attendance mode and the type of an event (confref-data decision 0016). The
edition number is per series: `cr:edition` when the event belongs to one series, otherwise one `cr:Edition` per
series.

## Academic fields and disciplines

Confref-data decision 0019. The fields are the concepts of the vocabulary `oecd-fos`
(`https://id.confref.org/data/oecd-fos/<code>`); the disciplines are Wikidata items.

### cr:field {#field}
```
cr:field
    a owl:ObjectProperty ;

## Ratings

Confref-data decision 0020. A rating is a statement of a rating system about a series or an event at a time, kept in
datasets of the kind `rating`, not in `ids`.

    <https://id.confref.org/data/ratings-springer-lod/aaecc/core>
        a cr:Rating ;
        cr:ratingOf <http://lod.springer.com/data/confseries/aaecc> ;

```
dcterms:date
    cr:label "date"@en ;
    cr:comment "On a rating: the date or year the rating refers to, or the date the source took it over."@en .
```

## Identity and history

**Identity.** The sources state that their records are the same as others (`owl:sameAs`, identifier properties);
confref keeps these statements as given. What confref itself states to be the same series or event is `cr:sameAs`: in
the linksets and in the identifier set `ids` (a series or event of confref and the records of the sources it brings
together). `cr:sameAs` is a subproperty of `owl:sameAs`.

**History of our identifiers.** The identifiers stay stable from version to version of `ids`. When the records show
that two identifiers stand for the same series or event, one is merged into the other (`cr:mergedInto`, the older one
is kept); when one identifier stood for several, it is split (`cr:splitInto`); an identifier that no longer stands
for a series or event is retired (`cr:retiredDate`). Each change is stated once, with the date of the version that
made it. An identifier is never used again.
